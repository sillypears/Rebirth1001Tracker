# Rebirth1001Tracker

Most of the work was done by Zamiell, I just updated it to use a better location of data.
  		  
This is a version of the item tracker for Rebirth, Afterbirth or Afterbirth+ to assist in seeing which items you've touched. It uses the save file for each of the DLCs accordingly. When launched, it will ask you for the save file. Navigate to the folder and select it. In order for item touches to be pushed to the save file, you have to exit to the menu and continue.
  		  
 Steam Cloud save location:
 * C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata\<your steam id>\250900\remote\
 * - persistentgamedata{1,2,3}.dat = Rebirth slot 1 2 or 3
 * - ab_persistentgamedata{1,2,3}.dat = Afterbirth slot 1 2 or 3
 * - abp_persistentgamedata{1,2,3}.dat = Afterbirth+ slot 1 2 or 3
  		  
There is no scrollbar, but you can use the following things to scroll:
* Mouse wheel
* Home / End
* PgUp / PgDn
